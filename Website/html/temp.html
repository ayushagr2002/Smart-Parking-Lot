            <h2 class="mb-4">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-5">By far the most favorite part of my project, music has held a special place in my heart tight from childhood. Music theory, the origins of music, is essentially
              math and I have explored that here. Commonly, rhythm or beats are associated with math but it is often forgotten that each musical note is a specific frequency. <br><br>
              Many musical occurrences and notions may be described mathematically. Mathematical frequencies have been used to characterize how strings resonate at specific frequencies, and acoustic waves are used to characterise these mathematical frequencies. Violins have a certain design that allows them to vibrate with their strings in a mathematical manner. 
              The schematics employed in music are analogous to scientific graphs in 2-D Cartesian coordinates. The x-axis denotes time, whereas the y-axis denotes frequency.

            <h2 class="mb-4">Relevant Music terms</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-5">When we hear a note, we are actually hearing a periodic sequence of vibrations; sound enters our ears as a sine wave, which compresses the air in a periodic pattern. This sine wave's frequency is defined by the frequency at which maximum and minimum air pressure alternate every second. 
              Sounds, including instrument notes, do not reach our hearing in their pure, fundamental sound wave form. Instead, the sound wave of the note is accompanied by overtones. An overtone is a note with a frequency that is an exact multiple of the fundamental frequency. A musical interval is the frequency ratio of two sound waves, one fundamental and one that is either a step lower or higher in pitch. <br><br>
              These two sounds would be sounded simultaneously or directly after one another. The prime is the most fundamental musical interval, in which the fundamental note is performed in contrast to itself. The octave is the following interval (second most basic), where the fundamental links to a second note with twice the frequency of the fundamental. 
              When the fundamental and second notes differ by an octave, the ratio is 1:2. This second note is an overtone of the first. <br><br>
              Harmonic pitch class profiles (HPCP) are a set of information extracted from an audio signal by a computer programme based on a pitch class profile—a descriptor proposed in the context of a chord identification system. HPCP are improved pitch distribution features that are sequences of feature that characterise tonality by measuring the relative intensity of each of the equal-tempered scale's 12 pitch classes inside an analysis frame. <br><br><br><br>
              Tonality is the organisation of a musical work's pitches and/or chords in a hierarchy of perceived connections, stabilities, attractions, and directionality. The tonic is the one pitch or triadic chord having the greatest stability in this hierarchy.

            <h4 class="mb-4">Fast Fourier Transform</h4>
            <p class="text-lg mb-5">
              The Fourier transform is an essential tool in many applications, particularly scientific computing and data research. As a result, SciPy has long offered an implementation of it as well as its associated transformations. 
              SciPy initially supplied the scipy.fft module. Fourier analysis is a field that studies how a mathematical function can be decomposed into a series of simpler trigonometric functions.
              The Fourier transform is a tool that allows you to take a signal and see the power of each frequency in it. The Fourier transform is useful in a variety of situations. Shazam and other music recognition systems, for example, employ the Fourier transform to identify songs. 
              To extract spoken words from raw audio, speech recognition employs the Fourier transform and related transformations.

            <h4 class="mb-4">Krumhansl-Schmuckler Key-finding Algorithm</h4>
            <p class="text-lg mb-5">
              Pitch class profiles have shown to be effective for key-finding during the previous few decades. A pitch class profile weights the 12 chromatic tones inside an octave based on their occurrence within a mode — for example, pitch class profiles for major and minor keys have been proposed. Similarly, an interval profile weights the 12 x 12 potential tone transitions inside the octave for two consecutive notes.
              Krumhansl and Kessler created key profiles for the major and minor modes, which indicate the relative prominence of tones on the chromatic scale. Listeners were asked to judge how well 'probe tones' fit into various musical settings, which resulted in these pitch class profiles. <br><br> 
              The Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm was proposed as a key-finding algorithm based on the idea that the pitch class distribution of the notes in a piece of music could reveal its tonality simply by calculating the correlation of the distribution with each of the 12 major and 12 minor profiles and predicting the highest correlated key.
