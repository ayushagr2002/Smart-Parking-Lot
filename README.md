# Smart-Parking-Lot
Project for Introduction to things (IoT) course in 2-1 - A smart Parking lot system which automates the process of parking of vehicles by 
- guiding them while parking 
- automatic gate opening whenever a car comes near the gate 
- fire alert system to alert in case fire breaks out in the parking area.

We can monitor the present state of the parking lot (like whether any parking slot is available or not) using the website. We can also observe the current real time temperature of the parking lot. This has been achieved using ThingSpeak Integration.
